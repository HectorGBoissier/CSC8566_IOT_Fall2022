# ESP32 Anjay Leshan Client

## Motivation

The purpose of this directory is to share my experience setting up and testing an ANJAY LWM2M client on Raspberry Pi for ESP32.

The tutorial provided in the [Building an LWM2M clients on RPI for ESP32](https://github.com/pschragger/IOT_Tutorials_for_VU/tree/main/RPI_BUILD_LWM2M_DEVICE) REAME.md file by Professor Schragger and the official documentation [Anjay ESP32 Client](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-esp32-client) by AVSystem was used as a reference to build and test the Anjay client.

The tutorial includes:
