# Anjay Client Experiments for ESP32

This is the continuation of the [Build LWM2M client on RPI for ESP32](https://github.com/HectorGBoissier/CSC8566_IOT_Fall2022/blob/Anjay-leshan/Anjay_Leshan_Client/Build_Anjay_Client.md) tutorial. 
Now that you are able to successfully register your ESP32 board on your Leshan server, you can experiment with the LwM2M Objects provided in the [Anjay client code](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-esp32-client) by AVSystem.
