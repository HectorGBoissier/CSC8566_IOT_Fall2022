# Humidity and Temperature Sensor on RPI using WiringPi

## Motivation

The purpose of this directory is to setup a Temperature and Humidity sensor on a Raspberry Pi 
used as a reference for this tutorial.

## Requirements

 ( Assume the reader has already setup a development IDE and solved comm issues) ( you can refer to other tutorials you expect they have completed before trying yours that includes mine or other students or your own) 
The tutorial steps were followed to download and install the software on the DietPi. Besides unstable connection and slow download speed, no major issues were encountered.
- Arduino 2.0
- Freenove Starter Kit

## Tutorial

- Specs and operation of accessing data of the analog device 
Install DHT sensor Library for ESPx
- Circuit diagram of microcontroller to analog device 
- Software snippet showing GPIO setup and runtime looping and temperature reading and writing results to output. 
- Images of resulting console and operation.
