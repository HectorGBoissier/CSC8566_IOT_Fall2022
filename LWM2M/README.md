# LWM2M Setup and Testing

## Motivation

The purpose of this directory is to share my experience setting up and testing a LWM2M server and client on the Raspberry Pi.
The steps provided in the **Device Management Install Tutorial** by Professor Schragger were followed to setup the Leshan server and client.
