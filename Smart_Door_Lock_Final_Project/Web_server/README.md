The Web Server used in this project is phpMyAdmin, which is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB.
This tool works as a portable web application written primarily in PHP and it provides great MySQL administration tools.
I installed this server on my Windows laptop with XAMPP, which you can easily download and setup following this link:
