## Firmware Updates
You can perform firmware updates which may unlock further capabilities on the GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2(Mango).

- Go to https://dl.gl-inet.com/?model=mt300n-v2 and click **Download** on the latest firmware version.
- On the router's Admin Panel, go to the **Upgrade** tab on the left side of the screen.
- Select the **Local Upgrade** option and drag the firmware file you downloaded into the upgrade box.
- Click **Install** and wait until finished updating. 
This process may take a few minutes and will disconnect you from the router wifi once it is complete.
