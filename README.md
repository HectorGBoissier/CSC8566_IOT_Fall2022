# CSC8566_IOT_Fall2022
Internet of Things Investigation Repo

@Author Hector Garcia Boissier

##Motivation

This repo will be used for my class work during the Fall 2022 IoT course at Villanova University.
The goal is to keep all assignment work and project code in the same repository.
By the end of the semester, I hope to be able to see my personal progress and use what I learned as a reference to keep exploring IoT in the future.
